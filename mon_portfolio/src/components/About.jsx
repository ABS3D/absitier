              ðŸŽ“ <strong>My Training Journey in Web Development and Data Analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed a <strong>400-hour Web Developer program at OpenClassrooms</strong>, where I worked on several real-world projects and developed strong technical skills in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>HTML5 / CSS3</strong>: building responsive websites (e.g., Booki, OhMyFood)</li>
              <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces</li>
              <li><strong>React.js</strong>: developing single-page applications (e.g., Kasa, personal portfolio)</li>
              <li><strong>SEO, accessibility, and web performance optimization</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Project management methodologies</strong>: version control, deployment, UX/UI best practices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This program awarded me a <strong>Level 5 RNCP diploma</strong>, officially recognized in France and equivalent to <strong>a 2-year associate degree (BAC+2)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I further strengthened my skills through a <strong>certified Software Engineering training program at Correlation One</strong>, where I learned to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Master modern <strong>front-end development</strong> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS)</li>
              <li>Work with <strong>APIs</strong>, perform <strong>CRUD operations</strong>, and use <strong>SQL databases</strong></li>
              <li>Apply best practices in <strong>debugging</strong>, <strong>version control (Git)</strong>, and collaborate using <strong>Agile/Scrum</strong> methodologies</li>
              <li>Solve common <strong>algorithmic challenges</strong> with precision</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I successfully completed this program and earned a <strong>certificate of completion</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, Iâ€™m continuing my specialization through a <strong>Data Analyst training program at Correlation One</strong>, where Iâ€™m deepening my expertise in data processing, statistical analysis, and professional data tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              In parallel, I have enrolled at <strong>Studi</strong> in the <strong>Bachelorâ€™s in Python Application Development</strong>, aiming to obtain a <strong>Bachelor's degree</strong> and further solidify my career in software development.
